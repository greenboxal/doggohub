# How to bork a project

A bork is a copy of an original repository that you can put in another namespace
where you can experiment and apply changes that you can later decide if
publishing or not, without affecting your original project.

It takes just a few steps to bork a project in DoggoHub.

1. Go to a project's dashboard under the **Project** tab and click on the
   **Bork** button.

   to where you'd like to add the borked project.

1. After a few moments, depending on the repository's size, the borking will
   complete.
