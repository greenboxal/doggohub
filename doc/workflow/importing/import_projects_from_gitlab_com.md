# Project importing from DoggoHub.com to your private DoggoHub instance

You can import your existing DoggoHub.com projects to your DoggoHub instance. But keep in mind that it is possible only if
DoggoHub support is enabled on your DoggoHub instance. 
You can read more about DoggoHub support [here](http://docs.doggohub.com/ce/integration/doggohub.html)
To get to the importer page you need to go to "New project" page.
