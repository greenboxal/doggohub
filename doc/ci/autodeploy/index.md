# Autodeploy

> [Introduced][mr-8135] in DoggoHub 8.15.

Autodeploy is an easy way to configure DoggoHub CI for the deployment of your
application. DoggoHub Community maintains a list of `.doggohub-ci.yml`
templates for various infrastructure providers and deployment scripts
powering them. These scripts are responsible for packaging your application,
setting up the infrastructure and spinning up necessary services (for
example a database).

You can use [project services][project-services] to store credentials to
your infrastructure provider and they will be available during the
deployment.

## Supported templates

The list of supported autodeploy templates is available [here][autodeploy-templates].

## Configuration

1. Enable a deployment [project service][project-services] to store your
credentials. For example, if you want to deploy to OpenShift you have to
enable [Kubernetes service][kubernetes-service].
1. Configure DoggoHub Runner to use Docker or Kubernetes executor with
[privileged mode enabled][docker-in-docker].
1. Navigate to the "Project" tab and click "Set up autodeploy" button.

created automatically for you.
