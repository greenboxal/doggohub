## DoggoHub UI development kit

We created a page inside DoggoHub where you can check commonly used html and css elements.

When you run DoggoHub instance locally - just visit http://localhost:3000/help/ui page to see UI examples
you can use during DoggoHub development.

## Design repository

All design files are stored in the [doggohub-design](https://doggohub.com/doggohub-org/doggohub-design)
repository and maintained by DoggoHub UX designers.
