# From 8.1 to 8.2

**NOTE:** DoggoHub 8.0 introduced several significant changes related to
installation and configuration which *are not duplicated here*. Be sure you're
already running a working version of at least 8.0 before proceeding with this
guide.

### 0. Double-check your Git version

**This notice applies only to /usr/local/bin/git**

If you compiled Git from source on your DoggoHub server then please double-check
that you are using a version that protects against CVE-2014-9390. For six
months after this vulnerability became known the DoggoHub installation guide
still contained instructions that would install the outdated, 'vulnerable' Git
version 2.1.2.

Run the following command to get your current Git version:

```sh
/usr/local/bin/git --version
```

If you see 'No such file or directory' then you did not install Git according
to the outdated instructions from the DoggoHub installation guide and you can go
to the next step 'Stop server' below.

If you see a version string then it should be v1.8.5.6, v1.9.5, v2.0.5, v2.1.4,
v2.2.1 or newer. You can use the [instructions in the DoggoHub source
installation
guide](https://doggohub.com/doggohub-org/doggohub-ce/blob/master/doc/install/installation.md#1-packages-dependencies)
to install a newer version of Git.

### 1. Stop server

    sudo service doggohub stop

### 2. Backup

```bash
cd /home/git/doggohub
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake doggohub:backup:create RAILS_ENV=production
```

### 3. Get latest code

```bash
sudo -u git -H git fetch --all
sudo -u git -H git checkout -- db/schema.rb # local changes will be restored automatically
```

For DoggoHub Community Edition:

```bash
sudo -u git -H git checkout 8-2-stable
```

OR

For DoggoHub Enterprise Edition:

```bash
sudo -u git -H git checkout 8-2-stable-ee
```

### 4. Update doggohub-shell

```bash
cd /home/git/doggohub-shell
sudo -u git -H git fetch
sudo -u git -H git checkout v2.6.8
```

### 5. Replace doggohub-git-http-server with doggohub-workhorse

Install and compile doggohub-workhorse. This requires [Go
1.5](https://golang.org/dl) which should already be on your system
from DoggoHub 8.1.

```bash
cd /home/git
sudo -u git -H git clone https://doggohub.com/doggohub-org/doggohub-workhorse.git
cd doggohub-workhorse
sudo -u git -H git checkout 0.4.2
sudo -u git -H make
```

Update the DoggoHub 'default' file.

```
cd /home/git/doggohub
test -e /etc/default/doggohub && \
  sudo sed -i.pre-8.2 's/^\([^=]*\)doggohub_git_http_server/\1doggohub_workhorse/' /etc/default/doggohub
```

Make sure that you also update your **NGINX configuration** to use
the new doggohub-workhorse.socket file.

### 6. Install libs, migrations, etc.

```bash
cd /home/git/doggohub

# MySQL installations (note: the line below states '--without postgres')
sudo -u git -H bundle install --without postgres development test --deployment

# PostgreSQL installations (note: the line below states '--without mysql')
sudo -u git -H bundle install --without mysql development test --deployment

# Run database migrations
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

# Clean up assets and cache
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake assets:clean assets:precompile cache:clear RAILS_ENV=production

# Update init.d script
sudo cp lib/support/init.d/doggohub /etc/init.d/doggohub
```
    
For Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS:

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload

### 7. Update configuration files

#### New configuration options for `doggohub.yml`

There are new configuration options available for [`doggohub.yml`](config/doggohub.yml.example). View them with the command below and apply them manually to your current `doggohub.yml`:

```sh
git diff origin/8-1-stable:config/doggohub.yml.example origin/8-2-stable:config/doggohub.yml.example
```

#### Nginx configuration

View changes between the previous recommended Nginx configuration and the
current one:

```sh
# For HTTPS configurations
git diff origin/8-1-stable:lib/support/nginx/doggohub-ssl origin/8-2-stable:lib/support/nginx/doggohub-ssl

# For HTTP configurations
git diff origin/8-1-stable:lib/support/nginx/doggohub origin/8-2-stable:lib/support/nginx/doggohub
```

If you are using Apache instead of NGINX please see the updated [Apache templates].
Also note that because Apache does not support upstreams behind Unix sockets you
will need to let doggohub-workhorse listen on a TCP port. You can do this
via [/etc/default/doggohub].

[Apache templates]: https://doggohub.com/doggohub-org/doggohub-recipes/tree/master/web-server/apache
[/etc/default/doggohub]: https://doggohub.com/doggohub-org/doggohub-ce/blob/8-2-stable/lib/support/init.d/doggohub.default.example#L34

### 8. Start application

    sudo service doggohub start
    sudo service nginx restart

### 9. Check application status

Check if DoggoHub and its environment are configured correctly:

    sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake doggohub:env:info RAILS_ENV=production

To make sure you didn't miss anything run a more thorough check:

    sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake doggohub:check RAILS_ENV=production

If all items are green, then congratulations, the upgrade is complete!

## Things went south? Revert to previous version (8.1)

### 1. Revert the code to the previous version

Follow the [upgrade guide from 8.0 to 8.1](8.0-to-8.1.md), except for the
database migration (the backup is already migrated to the previous version).

### 2. Restore from the backup

```bash
cd /home/git/doggohub
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake doggohub:backup:restore RAILS_ENV=production
```

If you have more than one backup `*.tar` file(s) please add `BACKUP=timestamp_of_backup` to the command above.

## Troubleshooting

### "You appear to have cloned an empty repository."

See the [7.14 to 8.0 update guide](7.14-to-8.0.md#troubleshooting).
