# From 7.3 to 7.4
*Make sure you view this [upgrade guide from the `master` branch](../../../master/doc/update/7.3-to-7.4.md) for the most up to date instructions.*

### 0. Stop server

    sudo service doggohub stop

### 1. Backup

```bash
cd /home/git/doggohub
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake doggohub:backup:create RAILS_ENV=production
```

### 2. Get latest code

```bash
sudo -u git -H git fetch --all
sudo -u git -H git checkout -- db/schema.rb # local changes will be restored automatically
```

For DoggoHub Community Edition:

```bash
sudo -u git -H git checkout 7-4-stable
```

OR

For DoggoHub Enterprise Edition:

```bash
sudo -u git -H git checkout 7-4-stable-ee
```

### 3. Install libs, migrations, etc.

```bash
# MySQL installations (note: the line below states '--without ... postgres')
sudo -u git -H bundle install --without development test postgres --deployment

# PostgreSQL installations (note: the line below states '--without ... mysql')
sudo -u git -H bundle install --without development test mysql --deployment

# Run database migrations
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

# Clean up assets and cache
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake assets:clean assets:precompile cache:clear RAILS_ENV=production

# Update init.d script
sudo cp lib/support/init.d/doggohub /etc/init.d/doggohub
```

### 4. Update config files

#### New configuration options for doggohub.yml

There are new configuration options available for doggohub.yml. View them with the command below and apply them to your current doggohub.yml.

```
git diff origin/7-3-stable:config/doggohub.yml.example origin/7-4-stable:config/doggohub.yml.example
```

#### Change timeout for unicorn

```
# set timeout to 60
sudo -u git -H editor config/unicorn.rb
```

#### Change Nginx HTTPS settings

* HTTPS setups: Make `/etc/nginx/sites-available/doggohub-ssl` the same as https://doggohub.com/doggohub-org/doggohub-ce/blob/7-4-stable/lib/support/nginx/doggohub-ssl but with your setting

#### MySQL Databases: Update database.yml config file

* Add `collation: utf8_general_ci` to `config/database.yml` as seen in [config/database.yml.mysql](/config/database.yml.mysql)

```
sudo -u git -H editor config/database.yml
```

### 5. Start application

    sudo service doggohub start
    sudo service nginx restart

### 6. Check application status

Check if DoggoHub and its environment are configured correctly:

    sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake doggohub:env:info RAILS_ENV=production

To make sure you didn't miss anything run a more thorough check with:

    sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake doggohub:check RAILS_ENV=production

If all items are green, then congratulations upgrade is complete!


### 7. Optional optimizations for DoggoHub setups with MySQL databases

Only applies if running MySQL database created with DoggoHub 6.7 or earlier. If you are not experiencing any issues you may not need the following instructions however following them will bring your database in line with the latest recommended installation configuration and help avoid future issues. Be sure to follow these directions exactly. These directions should be safe for any MySQL instance but to be sure make a current MySQL database backup beforehand.

```
# Stop DoggoHub
sudo service doggohub stop

# Secure your MySQL installation (added in DoggoHub 6.2)
sudo mysql_secure_installation

# Login to MySQL
mysql -u root -p

# do not type the 'mysql>', this is part of the prompt

# Convert all tables to use the InnoDB storage engine (added in DoggoHub 6.8)
SELECT CONCAT('ALTER TABLE doggohubhq_production.', table_name, ' ENGINE=InnoDB;') AS 'Copy & run these SQL statements:' FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'doggohubhq_production' AND `ENGINE` <> 'InnoDB' AND `TABLE_TYPE` = 'BASE TABLE';

# If previous query returned results, copy & run all shown SQL statements

# Convert all tables to correct character set
SET foreign_key_checks = 0;
SELECT CONCAT('ALTER TABLE doggohubhq_production.', table_name, ' CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;') AS 'Copy & run these SQL statements:' FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'doggohubhq_production' AND `TABLE_COLLATION` <> 'utf8_unicode_ci' AND `TABLE_TYPE` = 'BASE TABLE';

# If previous query returned results, copy & run all shown SQL statements

# turn foreign key checks back on
SET foreign_key_checks = 1;

# Find MySQL users
mysql> SELECT user FROM mysql.user WHERE user LIKE '%git%';

# If git user exists and doggohub user does not exist 
# you are done with the database cleanup tasks
mysql> \q

# If both users exist skip to Delete doggohub user

# Create new user for DoggoHub (changed in DoggoHub 6.4)
# change $password in the command below to a real password you pick
mysql> CREATE USER 'git'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$password';

# Grant the git user necessary permissions on the database
mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, LOCK TABLES ON `doggohubhq_production`.* TO 'git'@'localhost';

# Delete the old doggohub user
mysql> DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE user='doggohub';

# Quit the database session
mysql> \q

# Try connecting to the new database with the new user
sudo -u git -H mysql -u git -p -D doggohubhq_production

# Type the password you replaced $password with earlier

# You should now see a 'mysql>' prompt

# Quit the database session
mysql> \q

# Update database configuration details
# See config/database.yml.mysql for latest recommended configuration details
#   Remove the reaping_frequency setting line if it exists (removed in DoggoHub 6.8)
#   Set production -> pool: 10 (updated in DoggoHub 5.3)
#   Set production -> username: git
#   Set production -> password: the password your replaced $password with earlier
sudo -u git -H editor /home/git/doggohub/config/database.yml

# Start DoggoHub
sudo service doggohub start
sudo service nginx restart

# Run thorough check
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake doggohub:check RAILS_ENV=production
```


## Things went south? Revert to previous version (7.3)

### 1. Revert the code to the previous version
Follow the [upgrade guide from 7.2 to 7.3](7.2-to-7.3.md), except for the database migration
(The backup is already migrated to the previous version)

### 2. Restore from the backup:

```bash
cd /home/git/doggohub
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake doggohub:backup:restore RAILS_ENV=production
```
If you have more than one backup *.tar file(s) please add `BACKUP=timestamp_of_backup` to the command above.
