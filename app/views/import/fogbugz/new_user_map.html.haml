  %p
    Customize how FogBugz email addresses and usernames are imported into DoggoHub.
    In the next step, you'll be able to select the projects you want to import.

    The user map is a mapping of the FogBugz users that participated on your projects to the way their email address and usernames wil be imported into DoggoHub. You can change this by populating the table below.
  %ul
    %li
      %strong Default: Map a FogBugz account ID to a full name
      %p
        An empty DoggoHub User field will add the FogBugz user's full name
        (e.g. "By John Smith") in the description of all issues and comments.
        It will also associate and/or assign these issues and comments with
        the project creator.
    %li
      %strong Map a FogBugz account ID to a DoggoHub user
      %p
        Selecting a DoggoHub user will add a link to the DoggoHub user in the descriptions
        of issues and comments (e.g. "By <a href="#">@johnsmith</a>"). It will also
        associate and/or assign these issues and comments with the selected user.
